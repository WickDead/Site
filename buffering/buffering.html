    <h1 class="text-center">Buffering Issues</h1>
    <p>First things first this service is not perfect and never will be, there many factors that could affect buffering and issues on our end. These include:</p>
    <p>The source we are using is down or there are issues on there end, all we can do is change sources if there is another available.</p>
    <p>Overload on server with too many people watching. There are usually mutiple options for each channel, so please try other channel options if you can.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>For the most part there the channels will work as long as the interent it good, you may see the odd buffer but usualy they are few and far between.</p>
    <p>If you are having buffering issues the first thign you need to do is a speed test within the app and make sure you are getting good download speed. Follow the steps below.</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- Step 1 -->
      <li class="step">
        <div class="step-description">
          1. On the main screen of the app go to settings in the top right corner.
        </div>
        <div class="step-images">
          <!-- Add your images here. You can duplicate or remove the img tag as needed. -->
          <img src="main.png" alt="Description of image for step 1">
        </div>
      </li>
  
      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <li class="step">
        <div class="step-description">
          2. Find and click speed test
        </div>
        <div class="step-images">
          <!-- Add your images here. You can duplicate or remove the img tag as needed. -->
          <img src="speed.png" alt="Description of image for step 2">
        </div>
      </li>

      <li class="step">
        <div class="step-description">
          3. Begin the speed test
        </div>
        <div class="step-images">
          <!-- Add your images here. You can duplicate or remove the img tag as needed. -->
          <img src="begintest.png" alt="Description of image for step 2">
        </div>
      </li>

      <li class="step">
        <div class="step-description">
          4. After test is complete check the download speed, at minimun you want 20mbps, but ideally, its above 30 or more.
        </div>
        <div class="step-images">
          <!-- Add your images here. You can duplicate or remove the img tag as needed. -->
          <img src="done.png" alt="Description of image for step 2">
        </div>
      </li>

    <h3>If your speed is low, below or some of the reasons and solutions to fix the problem.</h3>
    <h3>If you speed is good and you are still having buffering issues please report the issue.</h3>
    <br/>
    <h2>Limited Internet Plan</h2>
    <p>The most straightforward reason could be the bandwidth limitations of your current internet plan. Streaming services, especially in high definition or 4K, require substantial bandwidth. If other devices are using the internet simultaneously, this can further strain your available bandwidth.</p>

    <h2>Wi-Fi Interference</h2>
    <p>Wi-Fi signals can be significantly affected by interference. Common sources of interference include other wireless networks in the vicinity, household appliances like microwaves, and physical obstructions like walls and floors.</p>

    <h2>Distance from Router</h2>
    <p>The further your Firestick is from your Wi-Fi router, the weaker the signal strength, which can lead to slower speeds and a less reliable connection.</p>

    <h2>Device Overload</h2>
    <p>If too many devices are connected to your Wi-Fi network, it can overload the router, leading to decreased performance.</p>

    <br/>
    <h1>Suggestions to Improve Internet Speed on Firestick</h1>

    <h2>Upgrade Internet Plan</h2>
    <p>Consider upgrading to a higher-speed internet plan that can comfortably handle your streaming needs.</p>

    <h2>Minimize Wi-Fi Interference</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Move your router to a more central location in your home.</li>
        <li>Keep it away from other electronic devices and large metal objects.</li>
        <li>Change the Wi-Fi channel on your router to a less congested one.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Optimize Router and Firestick Placement</h2>
    <p>Place the Firestick and router closer to each other and ensure there are as few obstructions as possible.</p>

    <h2>Use a Wi-Fi Extender/Booster</h2>
    <p>A Wi-Fi extender can boost the signal strength in areas of your home that are far from the router, providing a more stable connection to your Firestick.</p>

    <h2>Limit Device Connections</h2>
    <p>Disconnect or turn off devices that are not in use to reduce the load on your network.</p>

    <h2>Update Hardware</h2>
    <p>Ensure your Firestick and router firmware are up to date. Consider upgrading to a more modern router that supports the latest Wi-Fi standards.</p>

    <br/>
    <h1>Additional Considerations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Check for Firestick Updates: Regularly check for and install updates for your Firestick, as these can include performance improvements.</li>
        <li>Restart Devices: Sometimes, simply restarting your Firestick and router can resolve speed issues.</li>
        <li>Network Congestion: Be aware of peak usage times in your area, which can affect overall internet speed.</li>
        <li>Quality of Service (QoS) Settings: If your router has QoS settings, prioritize your Firestick to ensure it gets a larger share of bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By addressing these factors, you can significantly improve your Firestick's internet speed and enjoy a smoother streaming experience.</p>
